## ðŸ“¦ Download Pre-built Binary

This extension expects a prebuilt binary of the underlying C++ secret scanner to be available on your system. The binary performs the actual scanning work and must be present for the extension to function properly.

To get the latest version of the compiled binary for your operating system, please visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/drona-gyawali/secret-scanner/releases) and download the appropriate file.

Alternatively, if you'd like to build the scanner yourself, see the [Build Instructions](#-build-from-source-scanner-core) section.
