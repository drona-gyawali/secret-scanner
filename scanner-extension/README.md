### Manual Installation (Windows)

> **Note:** Currently, **Windows is not supported** for automatic binary setup.

To use **Secret Scanner** on Windows, you‚Äôll need to set it up manually by building the scanner locally.

#### Steps:

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drona-gyawali/secret-scanner.git
   ```
2. Follow the build instructions provided in the repo's **README** to compile the scanner binary for Windows.
3. Once built, locate the output file (e.g., `secret_scanner.exe`).
4. Move it to a preferred location (e.g., `C:\Tools\SecretScanner`).
5. In **VS Code settings**, configure the path:

   ```
   secret-scanner.customScannerPath = "C:\\Tools\\SecretScanner\\secret_scanner.exe"
   ```
6. Restart VS Code.

###  How it Works

1. **Smart detection order:**

   * Uses globally installed binary (e.g., in `~/.local/bin`)
   * Falls back to local workspace binary
   * Automatically downloads from GitHub releases if needed

2. **Security**

   * Verifies the binary using **SHA256 hash**

3. **No Manual Setup**

   * If a supported OS is detected, everything is handled automatically

### Manual Download

If you'd prefer or need to install the binary manually, download the latest prebuilt version from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/drona-gyawali/secret-scanner/releases).

To build it yourself, follow [these instructions](#-build-from-source-scanner-core).
