Secret Scanner is an advanced security toolkit designed to detect hardcoded secrets like API keys, tokens, and credentials in your source code. It combines a powerful C++ scanning engine (`scanner-core`) with a user-friendly **Visual Studio Code extension** (`scanner-extension`) to provide both CLI and GUI interfaces.

---

## Why Two Parts?

* **`scanner-core`** is written in C++ for performance. It can be used independently in CI/CD, Docker, or custom tooling.
* **`scanner-extension`** is a VSCode extension that uses the core scanner as a backend. It gives developers a seamless in-editor experience.

---

## Getting Started

### ðŸ“¦ Install Scanner Core (CLI Tool)

To use the secret scanner from the command line or within the VSCode extension, you need to install `scanner-core` globally.

#### Step 1: Build the Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drona-gyawali/secret-scanner.git
cd secret-scanner
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Step 2: Make It Global

```bash
cd build/scanner-core
sudo cp secret_scanner /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run it globally:

```bash
secret_scanner --help

Examples:
  ./scanner                   # Scan current 'src/' directory
  ./scanner /path/to/code     # Scan specific directory
  ./scanner .                 # Scan current directory
  ./scanner ../project        # Scan relative path

```

> **Note**: The instructions provided here are for Linux systems. If you are using Windows, please configure the build process accordingly based on your operating systemâ€™s CMake and compiler tools.

### Install VSCode Extension

> **Note:** Currently supported only on **Linux** and **macOS**. Prebuilt binaries are provided for these platforms. For windows setup the project and run locally.


You can install the VS Code extension from the Marketplace:

##  Features

* Detect common secret patterns (AWS keys, tokens, credentials, etc.)
* Scan files, folders, or entire workspaces
* Inline results with severity levels
* CLI + VS Code support
* Auto scan on save (optional)
* Lightweight, fast C++ core

---

## Tests

To run unit tests for the C++ core:

```bash
ctest
```

For the extension:

```bash
cd scanner-extension
npm install
npm test
```
