# secret-scanner

Secret Scanner is an advanced security toolkit designed to detect hardcoded secrets like API keys, tokens, and credentials in your source code. It combines a powerful C++ scanning engine (`scanner-core`) with a user-friendly **Visual Studio Code extension** (`scanner-extension`) to provide both CLI and GUI interfaces.

## Why Two Parts?

* **`scanner-core`** is written in C++ for performance. It can be used independently in CI/CD, Docker, or custom tooling.
* **`scanner-extension`** is a VSCode extension that uses the core scanner as a backend. It gives developers a seamless in-editor experience.

## Getting Started

### ðŸ“¦ Install Scanner Core (CLI Tool)

To use the secret scanner from the command line or within the VSCode extension, you need to install `scanner-core` globally.

#### Step 1: Build the Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drona-gyawali/secret-scanner.git
cd secret-scanner
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Step 2: Make It Global

```bash
cd build/scanner-core
sudo cp secret_scanner /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run it globally:

```bash
secret_scanner --help
```

> **Note**: The instructions provided here are for Linux systems. If you are using Windows or macOS, please configure the build process accordingly based on your operating systemâ€™s CMake and compiler tools.

### Install VSCode Extension

You can install the VS Code extension from the Marketplace:

    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Install%20Now-blue?logo=visualstudiocode&style=for-the-badge" alt="Install Secret Scanner Pro from Marketplace">
  </a>
</p>

>  To see how to use it in VS Code, refer to the [`scanner-extension/README.md`](scanner-extension/README.md) or [Usage Section](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drona-gyawali.secret-scanner-pro&ssr=false#overview).

---

##  Features

* Detect common secret patterns (AWS keys, tokens, credentials, etc.)
* Scan files, folders, or entire workspaces
* Inline results with severity levels
* CLI + VS Code support
* Auto scan on save (optional)
* Lightweight, fast C++ core

---

## Tests

To run unit tests for the C++ core:

```bash
ctest
```

For the extension:

```bash
cd scanner-extension
npm install
npm test
```
